## **Video Game Sales Analysis**

**Main Goal:**  
Analyze video game sales to explore changes in market trends.

## Dataset
Please download my data from [www.googledrive.com/gamesales_data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dx7yp0fWnURS0h0UkKhMuxsmAnJIr4X8/view?usp=drive_link) and put the resulting file in my project directory


## **Key Questions**
Macro-level:
1. How did global game sales changed over the years?
2. Which publishers are the most competitive globally over time, and what are their market shares?
3. What is the market share distribution among different game genres globally, and which genre is the most popular?

Micro-level:
1. What are the top 10 best-selling games globally each year and their sales?
2. What genres do these high-selling games belong to? Is there a trend of genre concentration?
3. Answer the above two questions based on regional sales.
4. How do the market shares of different game genres change each year? Which genres are growing or declining over time?
5. How do the market shares of different gaming platforms change each year? Which platforms are performing well?
   
Correlation Analysis:
Are user ratings and critic ratings correlated with global game sales?

Predictive Model Building:
Can game sales be predicted based on genre, platform, ratings, and other features?


## **Execution Plan**

1. Week 4: I will try to get access to the data from video game database. The backup kaggle dataset will be used once I faild to access

2. Week 5: Clean the data and organize it for analysis. Establish the entire framework of anlysis.

3. Week 6: Finishing the analyze at Macro-Level. Complete the crossponding visualizations.

4. Week 7: Finishing the analyze at Micro-Level. Complete the crossponding visualizations

5. Week 8: Select and build regression models, analyze the correlations of response variables, and summarize the analyses from the previous weeks

Finally, I will compile all analysis results and visualizations and complete a video recording.
