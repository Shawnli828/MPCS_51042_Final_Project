## **Video Game Sales Analysis**

**Main Goal:**  
Analyze video game sales to explore changes in market trends.


## **Key Questions**

1. What are the top 10 best-selling games globally each year and their sales?

2. What genres do these high-selling games belong to? Is there a trend of genre concentration?

3. Answer the above two questions based on regional sales.

4. How do the market shares of different game genres change each year? Which genres are growing or declining over time?

5. How do the market shares of different gaming platforms change each year? Which platforms are performing well?

6. What are the main factors that impact sales, for example, genre, platform, release time, and media ranking?


## **Execution Plan**

1. Week 4: I will try to get access to the data from video game database. The backup data will be used once I faild to access

2. Week 5: Clean the data and organize it for analysis.

3. Week 6: Rank the top 10 best-selling games, genres and platforms each year based on global sales and regional sales. Complete the crossponding visualizations.

4. Week 7: Calculate and visualize the annual sales growth or decline for the top genres and platforms.

5. Week 8: Select and build regression models, analyze the correlations of response variables, and summarize the analyses from the previous weeks

Finally, I will compile all analysis results and visualizations into a PowerPoint presentation and complete a video recording.
